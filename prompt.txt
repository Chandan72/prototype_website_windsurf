AI Automation Agency website. Goal: attract and convert B2B clients by showcasing tiered AI services and demonstrating ROI. Tech Stack: HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript. Styling: Modern, clean, professional, subtle purposeful animations.

**Objective:**
Generate three distinct, in-depth service pages in HTML, each representing one of our core service tiers. Each page must translate technical features into clear business benefits, follow a persuasive "Problem-Agitate-Solve" narrative, and be structured to appeal to both business executives (ROI focus) and technical stakeholders (how it works).

**Content Directives & Structure for EACH Service Page:**

**COMMON SECTIONS FOR ALL PAGES:**

1.  **Benefit-Oriented Headline (H1):**
    * **Directive:** Must immediately communicate the core value/outcome for the client. Avoid jargon.

    * **Directive:** Use a visually scannable format. Each point should highlight a clear, quantifiable business benefit.
    * **Content Focus:** Measurable impact (e.g., "Increased Lead Conversion," "Reduced Operational Costs," "Enhanced Decision-Making").

5.  **"How It Works" (H2 + Simplified Visual Explanation - Infographic/Diagram Concept):**
    * **Directive:** Designed for technical stakeholders. Provide a high-level, demystified explanation of the process or technology.
    * **Content Focus:** 3-4 step process flow (e.g., "Discovery & Strategy," "Implementation & Integration," "Measure & Optimize"). Placeholder for visual.

6.  **Relevant Case Study Snippet (H2 + Quote/Key Metric + Link):**
    * **Directive:** Embed a powerful, *directly related* client quote and a quantifiable result from a hypothetical case study.
    * **Content Focus:** Proof of value relevant to *this specific service tier*. Link to full case study page (placeholder URL).

7.  **Specific Call-to-Action (CTA Button):**
    * **Directive:** Tailored to the service, action-oriented, and value-driven.
